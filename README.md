This repository contains notes from classes I attended during engineering school. The structure and content align with what was taught and the materials (slides, laboratory classes) provided to us. I do not own anything that is shown here, I simply write it down with my own words and in a convenient format, so I (and others) can retrieve the concepts quickly and easily if needed.

Most of the notes are in English, but some remains in French...

If you notice errors (incorrect/deprecated statements) or typos, feel free to correct them at your leisure.

How to visualise the notes correctly:
1. Download obsidian
2. Install the `Automatic Table of Contents` plugin
