The scattergram indicates how homogeneous the values are
If the scattergram is dense (few points, mostly focused on a same position on the scattergram), the values are correlated. They are uncorrelated otherwise.
	*This allows us to compute spatial information on portions of an image. We can recognise patterns in an area (rectangular fields, buildings pattern, lakes ...)*
