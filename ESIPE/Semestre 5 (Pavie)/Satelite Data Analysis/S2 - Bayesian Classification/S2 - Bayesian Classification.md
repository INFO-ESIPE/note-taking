## Bayes Theorem

Allows inverse reasoning in probability density function 
	*p(x, C)*

p(x | C) is called the **likelihood**. It's the probability to observe `x` if `C` is known
p(C) is the **prior probability**. If this can't be found, we conclude that classes are equally proportioned (all have an equal proportion)
p(x) is the probability of the data
	*This does not depend on C, as it's not specified here ...*
