## Raster

Raster images are similar to bitmap really, it is just the opposite of vector data that is computed mathematically (object-oriented). Raster is just a grid where each cell contains a value.

The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) represent Earth's surface on 3D. It is possible to superimpose images of the surface on this model in order to obtain a realistic render.
	*The z axis represents the height, based on a reference level called **geoid***

We call pseudocolour a representation that applies a custom palette of colours on a greyscale representation in order to highlight details (this is especially used in maps or weather forecast presentations about temperature, winds ...)

## Vector

Mathematical approach. Essentially composed of points, lines and open/closed polygons.
