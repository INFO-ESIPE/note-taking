## What is classification ?

Classification in remote sensing involves assigning each portion of the Earth's surface to a predefined **class** (e.g., land cover types like water, vegetation, or urban areas). 
The output is typically a **thematic map**, providing actionable insights from satellite data.

This is useful in Machine Learning in various situations:
- Involves optimisation techniques to minimise error metrics like OA.
- Adequate training data is essential for supervised methods.

To obtain decent classification, it is mandatory to provide a **reliable training** to our algorithm.

Example of classification:

*Note that (Remote sensing) classification overlaps with **semantic segmentation** in computer vision.*


### Key Concepts

**Land Cover (LC) & Land Use (LU)**:
-  **LC**: The physical materials covering the Earth's surface (e.g., grass, water).
-  **LU**: The human-defined usage of the land (e.g., agriculture, residential).

**Classification Unit**: The smallest portion of data assigned to a class, often a pixel or a group of pixels (superpixel).

The **Classifier** is what assigns LC/LU to each classification unit:

**Hard vs. Fuzzy Classification**:    
-  **Hard**: Each pixel belongs to one and only one class.

- **Fuzzy**: Pixels can partially belong to multiple classes with assigned probabilities.

## Methods of Classification

**Supervised Classification** is a **knowledge-driven approach** where classes are predefined and the algorithm is trained on labeled data (Ground Truth).
1. Collect training data representative of each class.
2. Use it to "train" the classifier to recognise these classes in the dataset.

On the other hand, **Unsupervised Classification** is a **Data-driven approach** where the algorithm groups pixels based on inherent similarities.
	*No a priori information, only user-set parameters ‚Äì limited human input*

### Essential Elements of Classification

- **Ground Truth (GT)**: Accurate, external data used for training and validating the classifier.
	*Sample must be large and must be representative of the class it is intended to describe*

- **Test Set**: A separate dataset to evaluate the classifier's accuracy.

- **Sampling Strategies**: Methods for collecting representative data points; usually 50‚Äì100 samples per class.

## Evaluating Classification Results

We need to know how ‚Äúreliable‚Äù the classification is
	*how well the classification matches the actual at-ground situation*

### Confusion Matrix

We compare the classification with ground truth on a unit-by-unit basis (frequently
means pixel-by-pixel)
Once this is done, we store it into a **confusion matrix**, which is a table comparing predicted classes against actual Ground Truth classes.

*Here, pixels on the diagonal are correctly classified (classifier found the correct class)*

Two types of errors can occur:
- **Omission Errors**: Missed pixels for a class.
	*In red*
- **Commission Errors**: Incorrectly assigned pixels to a class.
	*In blue*

We can calculate the overall accuracy like so:
Number of correct pixels: 1345 + 2315 + 678 = 4328
Total number of pixels : 4766
```
Accuracy = 4328 / 4766 = 0.9080990... 
         = 90.81%
```


This is good, but we have a small issue: An accuracy greater than zero can be obtained even from a random class assignment to each single pixel
	 *Like when you answer randomly to a multiple choice questionnaire... some of them will be correct out of pure luck*

Can we fix this ?

### Kappa Coefficient `ùëò`

Measures classification accuracy while accounting for chance agreement.
We can attempt to compute this with a simple formula:
![[kappa.png|200]]

where `P0` is the probability of correct classification
and `Pc` is the probability of correct classification attributable to pure chance


This works, but it's not always reliable or appropriate for all applications.
