Remote sensing is about observing matter from afar. When this remote sensing comes to earth observation, we mostly uses satellites as a solution

Satellites uses **Electromagnetic (EM) radiations** as a carrier of the information we are interested in — to us, the measurer — as it is the quickest propagation possible in the void, without the need of any physical support (wire, storage).
This offers us small delay.

Long story short, an EM Radiation is a wave that propagates in one specific direction. This wave is made out of two fields :
- Electric Field (E); *This field works even if there is no matter (charge) around*
- Magnetic Field (M)

Those waves are oscillating together, and are related. If we change the size of E, the size of M is affected.


The wavelength (lambda) of a radiation determines its behaviour when it interacts with matter
All possible frequencies defines the **EM Spectrum**, even thought only a subpart of it is used :
- **UV** (Ultraviolet)
	- *Lower than 0,4 micrometers (Violet)* 
- **VIS** (Visible spectrum), the only one visible to the naked eye
	- *Purple — Violet in French :) — being near 0,4 micrometers, and Red close to 0,7 micrometers*
- **IR** (Infrared)
	- *Above 0,7 micrometers (beyond Red)*
	- If the value is between 0,7 and 3 micrometers, the Infrared is **reflected**
	- If the value is between 3 and 15 micrometers, the infrared is **emitted** 
- MW (Microwave)
As a human can only see the visible spectrum, we build sensors in order to detect EM radiations which are outside of the visible spectrum. 


The ozone layer absorbs UV. The atmosphere — and the various molecules it is composed of — absorbs most of the EM radiations wandering around (this absorption varies depending on the wavelength).
	*For instance, UVs are fully absorbed, while the ones on the VIS spectrum aren't.*

For this reason, you will never have UV censors for earth.
	*There are, however, UV sensors **outside the atmosphere** in order to observe other planets, as the EM aren't absorbed.*

Analysing matter from VIS waves is not a good idea, as we can't consistently recognise a material from its colouring. In general, we combine the result from several wavelengths in order to obtain a better approximation of the matter we attempt to analyse.
	*That is especially the case for analysing exoplanets — or say, Mars' surface for instance — as everything appears of an unique colour — red for Mars — thus not allowing us to clearly understand the matter around engines exploring the planet.*

Noise produces inaccuracy in our measurements, as it affects the EM radiations. 

Any entity with a temperature above the absolute zero (> 0 Kelvin) emits radiations (due to microscopic thermal motion. The higher the temperature is, the greater the motion is).

Planck law allows us to calculate the spectral emittance of an entity.
	The results heavily depends on the wavelength. If the wavelength (lambda) increases, the spectral emittance decreases.

Reflected infrared actually has two subsets, but only the **Near infrared** is interesting us as its the only of the two we can retrieve data from (the atmosphere absorbs waves on the other).


Scattering effect reveals all the elements (particles) wandering around in the air that might obfuscate waves. This effect is not visible when in plain light, as this haze effect is visible everywhere (scattering effect works better when, for instance, a small sunlight appears in a dark area, like a cavern).
