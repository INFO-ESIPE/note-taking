- Supervised and unsupervised learning :
	- **Supervised Classification** is a **knowledge-driven approach** where classes are predefined and the algorithm is trained on labeled data (Ground Truth).
	1. Collect training data representative of each class.
	2. Use it to "train" the classifier to recognise these classes in the dataset.

	On the other hand, **Unsupervised Classification** is a **Data-driven approach** where the algorithm groups pixels based on inherent similarities.
		*No a priori information, only user-set parameters â€“ limited human input*
	
	
- Active and passive sensor : 
	
	- **Passive:** Collecting incoming Electromagnetic radiations (information that is not generated by itself). It relies on an **opportunity emitter** (The sun for instance)
		*Small energy consumption, and has a behaviour that relies heavily on the source
		This includes photo cameras, video cameras, radiometers, thermal remote sensors...*
	
	- **Active:** Sensor that generates Electromagnetic waves in order to trigger a reaction it will collect (on the target)
		*Requires more power than a passive sensor, but work 24/7 in general
		This includes radars, LIDAR...


1. 1. Different types of resolution are important in remote sensing:
    
    1. **Temporal Resolution:** Frequency at which data is captured over time. For example:
        
        - High temporal resolution: Measurements taken less than 3 days apart.
        - Low temporal resolution: Measurements taken 16 days apart (typical for some satellites).
        
    2. **Spectral Resolution:** Ability of the sensor to distinguish between different wavelengths of the EM spectrum. Higher spectral resolution provides more detailed data but requires more storage capacity and can impact data availability.
    3. **Spatial Resolution:** Size of the smallest object that can be resolved in the image. It is determined by the **Ground Instantaneous Field Of View (GIFOV)**, which is the area on the ground that corresponds to a single pixel in the image. If a detail is smaller than the GIFOV, it will not be captured._Higher spatial resolution results in a more detailed and larger matrix of data._
    4. **Radiometric Resolution:** Ability of the sensor to distinguish between different levels of intensity or amplitude. Higher radiometric resolution allows for more precise measurements of the signal strength.
