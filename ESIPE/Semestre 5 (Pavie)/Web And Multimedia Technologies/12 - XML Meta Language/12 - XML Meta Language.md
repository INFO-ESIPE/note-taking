EXtensible Markup Language (XML) is used to describe data
	*Even though it was first designed to overcome some HTML limitations. That's why it appears with a similar `<tag>...</tag>` syntax*

XML is actually a **meta-language** (a "skeleton" language used to design other languages). Real languages can implement XML rules.
	*So, saying a document is written in XML is not completely true, we use a language that implements XML rules*
