An **Image Histogram** is defined on the 3 RGB channels, and represents the tonal/luminance distribution on a bitmap image.
	*You can obtain the level of "luminance"* by dividing the values of R+G+B by 3.
It is defined on an x and y axis.


PSD (or gimp) files are composed of **layers**. Layers are a superposition of bitmap—and sometimes vector—images.
