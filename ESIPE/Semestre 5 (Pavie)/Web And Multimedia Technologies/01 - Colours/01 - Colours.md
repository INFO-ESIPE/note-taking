## Models

There are several **colour models** allowing classification of colours based on their features :
- **RGB (additive)**
	Widely used for screens, ambient lightnings, video projectors
	Colours can be obtained by mixing values of **R**ed, **G**reen and **B**lue, each with a value between 0 and 255.
	White is obtained when all of the three have a max value.

- **CMY(K) (subtractive)**
	Used for printers as it is related to how ink absorb light on a sheet of paper
	This works as a subtractive model of **C**yan, **M**agenta, **Y**ellow (and blac**K**), each having a percentage value between 0 and 100. At the intersection of all the three aforementioned colours, we obtain black (unlike RGB where we obtain white).
	*This works in practice, but not in reality. This is why printers has black ink even though this model should be able to generate black. That is because a printer mixing those three colours will obtain a poor quality brown-ish colour instead of a solid black one*
	White is obtained when all of the three have the lowest value.

- **HSB/HLS**, Described by three parameters :
1. **H**ue (tint indicated from 0° to 360° on the colour wheel)

2. **S**aturation (how much it differs from neutral grey between 0 and 100%)
	![[saturation.png|500]]
	
3. **B**rightness/**L**ightness (from 0 to 100%)
	![[brightness.png|500]]

- **CIE (CIE XYZ, CIE LUV, CIE L\*a\*b)**
	**C**ommission **I**nternationale de l'**E**clairage, founded in 1913 to standardise lighting.
	Made out of the three aforementioned models, but L\*a\*b is the most widely used :
	- **L** (Luminance) - From white to black
		0 = black, 100 = white
	- **a** (chromatic component) - From green to red
		-128 = green, +127 = red
	- **b** (chromatic component) - From blue to yellow
		-128 = blue, +127 = yellow

> As we can guess, the chromatic component values can be represented on a signed byte.*
	

CMY and RGB are complementary :
- **CMY**:
	- Magenta + Yellow = **Red**
	- Cyan + Yellow = **Green**
	- Cyan + Magenta = **Blue**
- **RGB**:
	- Green + Blue = **Cyan**
	- Blue + Red = **Magenta**
	- Red + Green = **Yellow**

## Rendering

In practice, a printer (using the CMY model) overlaps layers of cyan, magenta and yellow in order to render colours. 
Poor quality **Inkjet printers (and sometimes laser printers)** uses **Halftoning (Variable dot sizes)** in order to render colours :
![[halftoning.png|350]]

On the other hand, **sublimation printers** allows us to obtain a smoother rendering as it correctly mixes the colour layers via **continuous tones**.


The **gamut** is the range of colours that is visible to us, thus that **can be generated by a colour model**. The **CMY** and **RGB** models both have their own different gamut (for instance, the RGB gamut contains more tones of green, while the CMYK contains more tones of orange) :
![[gamut.png|375]]

In the RGB model — as well as in some others — each component (R, G and B) is represented on a single unsigned byte (255 being 1111_1111). The logic that increasing the number of bytes per colour (going from 1 to 5, 10, 2000 bytes per colour) would allow a wider range of colours is misleading and wrong, as this **will not enlarge the gamut** in any way — thus not allowing us to render more colours.

## Colour Management System (CMS) 
*Not related to Wordpress-like technologies in any way*

The purpose is to standardise colour representation on different devices (monitors, printers, scanners...), making it consistent.
As devices uses different models (RGB for monitors, CYMK for printers), the CMS will exploit an independent colour model so devices can dialog correctly.

Colours are managed within a **virtual colour space**.
A CMS is composed of :
- A device-independent **colour space/model** (usually CIE L\*a\*b), that serves as an intermediate between incompatible colour models
- **Device profiles**, which acts as a dictionary for RGB and CYMK values **translating those values** to the ones used by the colour space, and vice-versa. 
	*In general, those profiles are stored inside `.icc` files. Those files are, in general, stored in system files, or along with drivers.*
- A **C**olour **M**anagement **M**odule (**CMM**)
	*Adobe does provide a state-of-the-art CMM that respects ICC (International Colour Consortium) standards.*

![[cms.png|550]]

A CMS just ends up being a rudimentary two columns array :
- A column containing three (or four, if CMYK) values (original colour on the device)
- Another column that gives the absolute representation of the other column's values

> [!info]
*For a printer, the first column will be the four values matching his CMYK colour model, and the second column will be the translation into CIE L\*a\*b.
For a monitor, the first column will be the standard L\*a\*b representation of the colour, and the second column will be it's translation in RGB.*
