t Usually 6 hours per week, but lacks of time. Teacher might seek for extra hours.
Monday 4-6 PM (B2)

Teacher will alert us beforehand if the upcoming class is a lab or a lecture (same for the room sometimes). 

Slides and various material isn't available publicly, it is possible to find it on a dedicated website (like E-Learning) AND on a drive (which requires the Univ email, as the access is restricted to specific users).

Send a mail to ask for access: marco.porta@unipv.it

Website: vision.unipv.it/wmt
Contains details on exams procedure, etc
Also has a restricted area containing the slides, password-protected: wmt!25!tmw

In 3 weeks we'll receive a quiz testing our knowledge on the topic.


Written exam (open questions and a few exercises)
*Examples of written exams will be provided beforehand, in order to guide us*
An optional oral exam (following the written exam) is available. Teacher will inform us about the schedule of those oral exams. 

A Mandatory project (solo):
- Website development
- Must include basic features and requirements
- Simply a way for the teacher to ensure we are able to develop a client-server web app (through technologies seen during the classes)
- The project must be finished up to 3 months **after** the written exam
- Must return the website, and a report
- Projects give up to 2 points in addition to the exam results


Lectures can be skipped. However, laboratories are mandatory as the teacher makes students sign a paper of presence.
If a lab class is missed, we will have to present our autonomous work in front of the teacher at the same time as we present him our project.

We begin with multimedia (web will come later on)
