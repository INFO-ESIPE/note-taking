## Concepts

### Multimedia and Interaction

Multimedia is a **presentation or interface** involving a combination of at least two elements, such as text, sound, images, animations, and videos.
Interaction defines the communication between a user and a system, where the user's input modifies the system's behaviour.

Two variants:
- **Offline Multimedia** (e.g., CD/DVD) has fewer constraints and allows for richer content and interactions.
- **Online Multimedia** is limited by factors such as storage, speed, and standardisation.

### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

**HCI** is the study of designing and evaluating interactive computing systems for human use, focusing on the interface as the gateway for communication between the user and the computer.  
	*Neglecting HCI aspects equates to neglecting the user...*

## Interaction Paradigms

> [!info]- Evolution of Interaction
> - **50s-60s**: Interaction via switches and punched cards (no real interaction).
> - **70s**: Text-based interaction with command-line interfaces.
> - **80s-90s**: GUI-based interaction using the WIMP model (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointing devices).
> - **2000s+**: Natural interaction using PUIs (Perceptual User Interfaces), incorporating voice, gestures, and more.

Common types of Interfaces:
1. **Multimedia Interfaces**: Focused on medium-specific output, such as text, graphics, and audio.
2. **Multimodal Interfaces**: Utilise multiple forms of input and output (e.g., voice, gestures).
3. **Perceptual Interfaces**: Equip systems with sensory faculties like sight and hearing.
4. **Perceptual Interfaces Integration**: Combine multimedia, multimodal, and perceptive aspects.

## Usability

Usability is the **extent to which a product achieves effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction** for specific users in a given context (ISO definition).  
Incorporating usability testing during the production cycle ensures better outcomes, with **iterative design** being the best practice.

The testing of usability:
- **Expert-based Methods**:
    - **Cognitive Walkthrough**: Analyse the ease of learning the interface.
    - **Heuristic Evaluation**: Examine the product against predefined usability criteria.
- **User-based Methods**:
    - Observation, questionnaires, verbal protocols, or experimental evaluation.
    - **Eye Tracking** is a sophisticated tool for analysing usability.

### Web usability and design

Major points:
- **Content Arrangement**: Ensure easy navigation, readability, and quick access to key information.
- **Page Design**:
    - Use relevant content to occupy at least 50% of the page.
    - Avoid non-standard content that requires plugins.
    - Maintain a quick response time (<10 seconds).
- **Link Design**: Clear, descriptive, and consistent link styles.
- **Navigation**: Help users identify where they are, where they've been, and where they can go.

## Future of HCI

**Gesture Interaction**: Using gestures for controlling devices, interacting at a distance, or biometrics. Examples include the discontinued Microsoft Kinect and Leap Motion.

**Eye Tracking**: Tracks user gaze to improve interaction. Can be **remote** or **wearable**.

**Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)**: Facilitates interaction by translating neural activity into computer commands.
