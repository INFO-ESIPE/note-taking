## Concept

Web **accessibility** is about allowing people with disabilities to use the web **via technical aspects and well-defined rules**, while **usability** is more related to **pure logic and abstract concepts**.

## Regulations

### WCAG 1.0

Web accessibility standards are defined by the 14 guidelines of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

> [!info]- Useful tools and resources
> Guidelines: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/
> Accessibility Checker: https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/
> Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List: https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/

Each checkpoint has a **priority level**:
- Priority 1: Must be satisfied
- Priority 2: Should be satisfied
- Priority 3: May be satisfied

And depending on how a website implements those guidelines, it is attributed a **conformance level**:
- Level A: Satisfies all priority 1 checkpoints
- Level AA: Satisfies all priority 1 & 2 checkpoints
- Level AAA: Satisfies all priority 1, 2 & 3 checkpoints

> [!example]- 1.0 Guideline example
> Guideline 2: Don’t rely on colour alone
> Ensure that text and graphics are understandable when viewed without colour
> - `[Priority 1]` Checkpoint 2.1: Ensure that all information conveyed with colour is also available without colour
> - `[Priority 2]` Checkpoint 2.2: Ensure that foreground and background colour combinations provide sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having colour deficits or when viewed on a black and white screen

### WCAG 2.0

Based on 1.0, but has a different philosophy that follows four main principles:
1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable
3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies

> [!example]- 2.0 Guideline example
> Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
> - Controls, Input: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose
> - Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology

## Assistive technologies
*We focus on motion and vision issues here, but solutions also exists for hearing and cognitive issues.*

For people with vision disabilities:
- Screen magnifiers
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS)
- Braille readers (mostly for deaf-blind people)

For people with motion disabilities:
- Speech recognition
- Eye tracker
- Mouth sticks and head wands
- Special keyboards

## Generic rules for accessible design

**Text:**
1. The `lang=` HTML attribute allows to specify a language for an element.
   Good practice is to define a global language on the `<html>` tag (which will apply to the overall page). If some text on the page comes from a different language, it is good practice to put it in a dedicated `<span>` tag, and specify the language.
2. Use meaningful page titles
3. Use tags correctly (`<h1>` for head titles ...)
```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>My Appointments</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Appointments:</h1>
		<p>You have a <span lang="fr">rendez-vous</span> at 4:00 PM next friday.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

**Font:** Use relative sizes, as it allows the user to enlarge fonts manually at his leisure.

**Colour contrast**: 
1. Do not rely on colour alone to pass information, as colourblindness is very common
2. Use contrasting colours for text and background, with high difference in both luminance and chrominance.
> [!example]- W3C Formula
> Luminance = ((R * 299) + (G * 587) + (B * 114)) / 1000
> The overall rule is: background lumin. - foreground lumin. | > 125
> 
> Chrominance = \[Max(R1, R2) – Min (R1, R2)] + \[Max(G1, G2) – Min (G1, G2)] + \[Max(B1, B2) – Min (B1, B2)]
> The overall rule is: chrominance > 500

**Generic multimedia**: Use the `alt=` attribute to describe the content.
1. Deaf people: provide transcripts for speech audio and captions for videos
2. Blind people: Provide text or audio descriptions for videos
> [!caution]- Mind the correct usage of `alt` attribute
> The `alt=` attribute is not a caption! Captions are for those who can see...
> Let's add a text alternative for this pie chart:
> ![[piechart-alt.png|400]]
> - Wrong usage: Chart of sales in 2012
> - Correct usage: Sales in 2012: books 69%, CDs 11%, stationery 15%, sweets 5%

**Navigation**:
1. Make links and form fields directly selectable through the `accesskey` attribute:
```html
<a href="p2.html" accesskey="2">Page 2</a>
<input type="text" id="date" accesskey="d" />
```
2. Use meaningful words for links (avoid "click here" links)
3. Avoid opening new windows (misleading, especially when using screen readers)
4. Avoid using JavaScript links (same issue as above)
5. Add titles to links via the `title=` attribute:
```html
<a href="b.html" title="Biography of…">…</a>
```
