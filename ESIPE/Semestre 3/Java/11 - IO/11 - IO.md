## Refresher

History:
- Java 1.0: `InputStream`/`OutputStream`, `IOException`
	*`java.io`*
- Java 1.1: `Reader`/`Writer`
- Java 1.4: `ByteBuffer`, `Charset`, `*Channel`
	*`java.nio.[buffer, charset]`*
- Java 1.7: `Path`, `Files`, try-with-resources
	*`java.nio.file`*

To remember:
- Binary format: `InputStream`/`OutputStream`
- Text: `Reader`/`Writer` with a `Charset`
- An opened file is a system resource we must free (close).
- `IOException` must be propagated
- `java.io.File` wasn't implemented correctly, use `java.nio.file.Path` instead


***
## Path

As mentioned above, represented by `java.nio.file.Path`.
Through a factory method:
- `Paths.get(filename)`
- `Paths.get(directory, filename)`

Under the hood, its a linked list of names leading to the root `/`:
`/ <- home <- sunless <- project <- src <- fr <- uge ...`
	*The `Path` class deals with `/` and `\` for us, don't worry about it*

As we know, there are different kinds of paths:
- Relative: Depends on current workdir
	`../aoc2024/input`
- Absolute: Starts at the root directory) 
	`/home/sunless/project/../aoc2024/input`
- Canonical: Fully-resolved path with no usage of `.` nor `..`)
	`/home/sunless/aoc2024/input`
- Real: Always point to real locations on file system (including symlinks)
	Similar to canonical but focuses on resolving symbolic links specifically
	If `/home/sunless` is a symlink to `/mnt/data/user_sunless`, it will be resolved. 

Manage paths:
- `String toString()`: Returns path as a string (keeps the given form)
- `Path getFileName()`: Returns the **last element** in the path (so, it can also be a directory lol)
- `Path getParent()`: Returns parent directory of the current path
- `Path toAbsolutePath()`: Converts the given path to its absolute counterpart
- `Path toRealPath(LinkOption)`: Converts to the real path, resolving everything
	*`linkOption` allows to resolve symbolic links*
- `Path normalize()`: Removes all `..` and `.`
- `Path resolve(Path) / resolve(String)`: Concatenates the given path or string to the current path, treating the argument as a **child element** unless itâ€™s absolute
```java
Path base = Paths.get("/home/user");
System.out.println(base.resolve("aoc2024/input")); // /home/user/aoc2024/input
System.out.println(base.resolve("/absolute/path")); // /absolute/path
```

- `Path resolveSibling(Path) / resolveSibling(String)`: Substitutes the **last element** of the current path with the given sibling path or string
```java
Path base = Paths.get("/home/user/aoc2024");
System.out.println(base.resolveSibling("project")); // /home/user/project
```

- `Path relativize(Path path)`: Computes the relative path from the current path to the specified path (only when both paths have the same root)
	*Opposite of `resolve`*
```java
Path p1 = Paths.get("/home/user"); 
Path p2 = Paths.get("/home/user/aoc2024/input"); 
System.out.println(p1.relativize(p2)); // aoc2024/input
```


***
## `java.nio.file.Files`

Allows to see a `Path` like a file. It contains all methods to create/destruct/read/write on files.
It throws `IOException` if something wrong happens!
Keep in mind that access to filesystem is **concurrent**. Other entities might manipulate it at the same time, it might even get removed by someone else while we are reading/writing in it.

**Create:** `createDirectory()`, `createFile()`, `createLink()`, `createSymbolicLink()`, `createTempDirectory()`, `createTempFile()`
**Existence**: `isDirectory()`, `isRegularFile()`, `isHidden()`
**Permissions:** `getOwner()`, `getPosixFilePermission()`, `getFileAttributeView()`
**Traverse files in a directory:**
- `Stream<Path> list()`: All entries (files and directories) in a directory as a **`Stream`**.
```java
try (Stream<Path> stream = Files.list(Paths.get("/home/user"))) {
    stream.forEach(System.out::println); // Prints all files and directories
}
```
> [!info]
> Not recursive

- `newDirectoryStream()`: Provides a **non-Stream** way of iterating over directory contents. This behaves like an **iterator**.
```java
try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(Paths.get("/home/user"))) {
    for (Path path : stream) {
        System.out.println(path); // Prints each file or directory
    }
}
```
> [!info]
> Not recursive

- `walkFileTree()`: Traverses a directory tree using a **visitor pattern**. This is more suitable for complex traversal tasks like custom filtering, visiting directories, or performing specific actions on files.
```java
Files.walkFileTree(Paths.get("/home/user"), new SimpleFileVisitor<>() {
    @Override
    public FileVisitResult visitFile(Path file, BasicFileAttributes attrs) {
        System.out.println("File: " + file); // Execute for each file
        return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
    }
    
    @Override
    public FileVisitResult visitFileFailed(Path file, IOException exc) {
        System.err.println("Failed to access: " + file); // Handle errors
        return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
    }
});
```
> [!info]
> Recursive

- `Stream<Path> walk()`: Walks a directory tree and returns a **Stream** of `Path` objects, enabling flexible operations like filtering and mapping. Unlike `list()`, this method can traverse subdirectories.
```java
try (Stream<Path> stream = Files.walk(Paths.get("/home/user"))) {
    stream.filter(Files::isRegularFile)  // Only regular files
          .forEach(System.out::println); // Prints all files recursively
}
```
> [!info]
> Recursive. `maxDepth` can be specified as a second parameter if we want to limit recursion.

## I/O streams

Two main ways of doing it:
- Stream of `byte`: `InputStream`/`OutputStream`
- Stream of `char`: `Reader`/`Writer`
	*Requires a `Charset` for encoding*

### Byte streams
*To read binary files, mostly*

#### `InputStream` 

Creation (reading): `InputStream newInputStream(Path)`
Manage the reading stream:
- Read an array of bytes: `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`
	***Blocking method** which returns the amount of bytes that were read. `off` and `len` are optional.
	Reminder: reading is a request, not a guarantee. The system will attempt to fill the buffer as much as it can but it might not always fill it completely!*
- Skip `n` bytes: `long skip(long n)`
- Close the stream: `void close()`

==Never use `int read()`, it's not efficient at all

#### `OutputStream`

Creation (writing): `OutputStream newOutputStream(Path)`
Manage the writing stream:
- Writes an array of bytes: `void write(byte[] b, int off, int len)`*
- Close the stream: `void close()`

==Never use `void write(int b)`, it's not efficient at all

Example - Copy input to output:
```java
public static void copy(InputStream in, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
	byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
	int size;
	while((size = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
		out.write(buffer, 0, size);
	}
}
```
> In fact this already exists: `inputStream.transferTo(outputStream)`.

#### Automatic buffering

As you can see, the aforementioned classes aren't buffered by default (unlike `stdio` in C), we have to manually pass an array of bytes as parameter.

Alternative classes `BufferedInputStream`/`BufferedOuputStream` are doing automatic bufferisation. These classes act as intermediaries, placing a buffer between the data stream and the underlying system to reduce the number of direct I/O operations.

By **wrapping** your streams with these buffered classes, you benefit from smoother and faster data transfers due to the buffering mechanism:
```java
BufferedInputStream(InputStream input,int bufferSize)
BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream input,int bufferSize)
```

### Character streams
*To read textual files*

Creation (reading): `BufferedReader newBufferedReader(Path, Charset)`
	*If charset not specified, uses UTF-8 by default*
Creation (writing): `BufferedWriter newBufferedWriter(Path, Charset)`
	*Same thing as above for charset*

#### Charset

In java, characters are manipulated in unicode (2 bytes).
Files can use another format:
- ASCII (1 byte)
- ISOLatin 1 (1 byte, includes letters with accents)
- MS Windows Latin 1...

`ava.nio.Charset` defines the char/byte conversion array. Mostly two methods for the conversion:
- `CharsetEncoder newEncoder()`: `byte` -> `char`
- `CharsetDecoder newDecoder()`: `char` -> `byte`

We can obtain a charset in two ways:
- `Charset.forName(String name)`, which returns the corresponding charset
- (Better) via `java.nio.charset.StandartCharsets`, which defines all default charsets as static variables
	`US-ASCII`, `UTF-8/16`, `ISO-8859-1` (A.K.A. ISO-LATIN-1) ...

#### String

We can directly convert an array of bytes (+ charset) into a string, and vice versa:
- `String(byte[] bytes, Charset charset)`
- `String(byte[] bytes, int offset, int length, Charset charset)`
- `string.getBytes(Charset charset)`

#### Reader

Manage the reading stream:
- Read an array of characters: `int read(char[] buffer, int off, int len)`
- Skip `n` characters: `long skip(long n)`
- Close the stream: `void close()`

==Never use `int read()`, it's not efficient at all

#### Writer

Manage the reading stream:
- Write an array of characters: `int read(char[] buffer, int off, int len)`
- Write a string: `void write(String s)`
- Close the stream: `void close()`

==Never use `void write(int c)`, it's not efficient at all

#### Buffering

Like for bytes streams, there is a buffered counterpart `BufferedReader`. It allows to manipulate lines directly, via `String readLine()`.

Example: count occurrence per word:
```java
public static Map<String, Long> wordCount(BufferedReader reader) {
	return reader.lines() // Split by line first
		.flatMap(line -> Arrays.stream(line.split(" "))) // Then split by word
		.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(w -> w, Collectors.counting())); // Count
}
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
	var path = Paths.get(args[0]);
	try(var reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
		System.out.println(wordCount(reader));
	}
}
```
> An alternative called `LineNumberReader` also exists. It inherits from `BufferedReader` (so provides the same features) but also maintain line numbers.


***
## System resources

Each process possesses [[04 - File System#Low-Level|an array of opened file descriptors]].
When we open a file, we use a slot in this array. If the table is full, we get an `IOException`
	*Note that you can change the table's size with `ulimit`*

Having a filled fd table is a messy situation, that's why we must **manually** free when we stop using them.
	*We can't rely on the GC to do it for us, as we can't predict WHEN he will move his stupid ass... Our table can be full before he does anything.*

A first approach would be to use a `try-finally`:
```java
Path path = // ...
var input = Files.newInputStream(path);
try {
	input.transferTo(System.out);
} finally {
	input.close(); // Free resources in any situation after the try block
}
```

But we don't use this approach anymore because:
```java
Path path = // ...
var input = Files.newInputStream(path);
try {
	input.transferTo(System.out); // <-- Can throw an IOException(1)
} finally {
	input.close(); // <-- Can throw an IOException(2)
}
```
> [!bug]
> If both throws happens, we will only retrieve `IOException(2`, and lose all trace of the first one (which contains more interesting details, to be fair).

A better alternative is the `try-with-resources`:
```java
Path path = // ...
try(var input = Files.newInputStream(path)) {
	input.transferTo,(System.out);
} // calls close() implicitly here
```
> [!success] Good, but:
> - The resource must be a `java.lang.AutoCloseable`
> - If `close()` raises an exception, it is binded to the first exception as a "suppressed exception", as we have already explained [[07 - Exceptions#Exceptions and I/O|here]]. 
> - If we open several resources, they are closed in reverse order 

If we use a `Buffered*`, we must declare it on several steps:
```java
// Incorrect: If Buffered* constructor raises an Exception
// the descriptor sotred in the input stream will not be closed!
Path path = // ...
try(var buffered = new BufferedInputStream(Files.newInputStream(path)) {
	// ...
}

// Correct
Path path = // ...
try(var input = Files.newInputStream(path);
	var buffered = new BufferedInputStream(input)) {
	// ...
}
```


***
## Console

stdin: `System.in`
	*`InputStream` (not buffered)*
stdout: `System.out`
	*`PrintStream`, an alternative to `OutputStream` that includes printing functions (`print`, `println`...)*
stderr: `System.err`
	*`PrintStream`*

We can access the console with `System.console()`.
	*Caution: return `null` if the process is not binded to a tty*
Now, we can access the following operations:
- `Reader reader()`
- `String readLine(String fmt,Object... args)`
- `char[] readPassword(String fmt,Object... args)`
- `Writer writer()`
- `Console printf(String format, Object... args)`
- `Console flush()`

Example: simulate `cat`:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
	var console = System.console();
	if (console == null) {
		throw new IOException("no console available");
	}

	var input = (args.length == 0) ?
		console.reader():
		Files.newReader(Paths.get(args[0]));
	try(var reader = input;
		var writer = console.writer()) {
		reader.transferTo(writer);
	}
}
```

## Direct file manipulation

Done via `java.nio.channel.FileChannel`. We create with a static method:
`FileChannel.open(Path, OpenOptionâ€¦)`, where `OpenOption` is:
- CREATE (create file if it doesn't exist already)
- CREATE_NEW (fails if file already exists)
- APPEND
- TRUNCATE_EXISTING (starts from position 0)
- DELETE_ON_CLOSE (file disappears when closed, like a temp file)
- SPARSE (avoid to allocate space when possible)
- SYNC (every update to the file's content or metadata be written synchronously to the underlying storage device)
- DSYNC (SYNC but without metadata)

It offers blocking I/O operations:
- **Read:** `read(ByteBuffer)`/`read(ByteBuffer, position)`
- **Write**: `write(ByteBuffer)`/`write(ByteBuffer, position)`
- **Force Synchronisation to Disk**: `force(boolean metadata)`
	*Ensures that changes are written to the disk. `metadata` indicates whether to also sync file metadata.*
- **File Locking**:
	- `lock()`: Locks the entire file.
	- `lock(position, size, shared)`: Locks a specific region, with an option for shared or exclusive locking.
	- `tryLock()`: Attempts to acquire a lock without blocking.

We release resources with `close()`/

### `AsynchronousFileChannel`

Asynchronous alternative to `FileChannel` that supports non-blocking I/O operations.
- **Read/Write with Futures**
    - `Future<Integer> read(ByteBuffer, position)`
    - `Future<Integer> write(ByteBuffer, position)`  
        *The `Future` object lets you retrieve the result later, as we have used [[09 - ExecutorService#`ExecutorService` with `Future<T>`|for ExecutorService]] .
- **Read/Write with Completion Handlers**
    - `void read(ByteBuffer, position, attachment, completionHandler)`
    - `void write(ByteBuffer, position, attachment, completionHandler)`  
	    - `attachment`: An optional object passed to the `completionHandler`.
	    - `completionHandler`: A callback executed once the operation is complete.

### `MappedByteBuffer`

Allows to map a file's content directly into memory for efficient access.
`MappedByteBuffer map(mode, position, size)`
    `mode` defines access mode
        READ_ONLY: Read-only access.
        READ_WRITE: Allows reading and writing.
        PRIVATE: Changes are private to the memory buffer.

The system automatically loads relevant parts of the file into memory as needed.


***
## Serialization

Serialization allows to convert the state of an object into a byte stream, while Deserialization does the opposite.
We can only serialise an object if its class allows it. It must implement the empty ` java.io.Serializable` interface.

The serialisation works like this: All fields are saved recursively (with cycle detection).
	*Fields declared as `transient` aren't saved, they are instead loaded with their default value.*
```java
public class A {
	private final int a;
	public A() { a = 3; }
}

public class B extends A implements Serializable {
	private transient int b = 8;
	private final int c;
	public B(int c) { this.c = c; }
}

var b = new B(5); // a = 3, b = 8, c = 5
out.writeObject(b); // saves c = 5

var b = (B) in.readObject(); // a = 3, b = 0, c = 5
```
