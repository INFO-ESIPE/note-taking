[[Concurrence]]
****

**Paradigms:**
- Concurrency: Running multiple calculations simultaneously (what we are doing since the beginning of this class).
- **Parallelism**: Splitting a calculation across multiple threads.
- Vectorization (Vectorized Operations): Executing a single operation (e.g., addition) on multiple data points in memory using a single thread.
- Distributed Processing: Spreading a calculation across multiple machines.
